Welcome to SFF

SFF stands for Sitecore Front-end Friends. SFF's mission is to spread awareness about front-end development with the Sitecore Experience Platform, make front-end developers more involved in developing Sitecore applications, as well connecting people to make new friends. We have a strong focus on Sitecore JavaScript Services (JSS), and we are also interested in Sitecore Experience Accelerator (SXA), SPEAK 3, Sitecore Sidekick, and other front-end related technologies.
